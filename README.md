# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) – Revision Repository

Welcome to my **DSA Revision Repository**, where I consistently revise, document, and practice fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms to stay interview-ready and improve my problem-solving skills.

This repository contains:
- Clean and optimized solutions
- Properly structured folders
- Explanation notes
- Multiple approaches (Brute → Optimized)
- Java implementations 

---

Each folder includes:
- Problem statement  
- Thought process  
- Time & space complexity  
- Code (Java)  
- Edge cases  
 

---

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists?

I created this repository to:

✔ Keep my DSA concepts sharp  
✔ Avoid forgetting fundamentals  
✔ Maintain a structured record of problems  
✔ Prepare for interviews & coding assessments  
✔ Share clean DSA code with the community
